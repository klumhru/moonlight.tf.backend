Moonlight Terraform Backend
===

This is the backend configuration for the Moonlight project. It includes the deployment tools and state storage, as well as the DynamoDB locking table.

To use this the aws bucket actually needs to be created first, or the state stored locally and then pushed to the bucket afterwards.
